# Exercise Tracker
An exercise tracking web app to plan out a workout routine! Users can track their workouts and organize their routine according to the different muscle groups that were worked.
The backend was made using Express.js and MongoDB, and the user interface was made with Javascript and HTML/CSS.
There will be more features added, so that users can further personalize and enhance their experience.

Here is a GIF that demonstrates how it works:
